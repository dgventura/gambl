For a summary of supported game music file formats and description of their characteristics, see the separate document Game Music Overview.Playing Music

(*asterisk indicates currently unsupported but planned functionality*)Drop music files or folders of music files on the Game Music Box application icon or double-click them to start playing them immediately and clear the previous playlist. Drop items on the player window to append them to the current playlist.The player window shows information about the current track and allows skipping forward through the playlist or back through previous tracks. To reduce the window to just the track controls and track name, click the collapse button in the title bar.The track control buttons and keyboard equivalents perform the following functions: Button  Keyboard      Function--------------------------------------------------------------    <<   Left Arrow    Previous track   >/||  Spacebar      Play/Pause    >>   Right Arrow   Next track (*keep held for fast-forward*) (none)  Esc or Cmd-.  Stop and clear playlist             -         Lower volume            +/=        Raise volume**To quickly change tracks, hold the left/right arrow key until it repeats. To fast-forward through the current track, use the mouse to press and hold the next track button.**The icon in the title bar of the player window is similar to that in Finder windows. Hold the command key while clicking the title to get a popup with the path of the current music file. Select the enclosing folder to reveal the current file in the Finder.When the player window is in the background, track controls can still be used. In Mac OS X press and hold the mouse button over the GaMBL application icon in the dock to bring up a menu with basic track controls.There is currently no way to show a list of tracks in the current playlist.Playback OptionsThe Playback menu has track playback options:Shuffle Tracks causes tracks to be played in random order from the playlist. The tracks from music albums are shuffled individually rather than as a single unit (applies to NSF, NSFE, GBS, and archives).Skip Short Tracks causes short tracks to be skipped over, useful for removing sound effects and short tunes. Specifically, tracks with timing information (NSFE, VGM, GYM, some SPCs) that are ten seconds or less. Tracks without timing information will not be skipped (NSF and GBS have no timing information at all).Extend Current adds one minute to the play time of the current track only. This is useful if you are enjoying the current track and want to listen to it longer. This item is disabled for tracks which can't be extended (Sega Genesis and Master System tracks which have no loop points set).Short, Normal, Extended, and Endless adjust the track play length. These change the time a track plays before it fades out, relative to the track's normal length (2.5 minutes if music file doesn't have timing information). The play length of the current track is shown in the main window. Note that some tracks can't be extended.Sound Control in the View menu opens the channels window. In that window, Customize Sound is available for Nintendo, Game Boy and Master System music. When off, each system's unique sound quality is used; when on, the sliders override this with custom treble, bass, and stereo depth settings. Below that, individual channels can be muted to allow examination of how a song is constructed. Channels are muted only while the channels window is open.Recording TracksTracks from music files can be recorded to wave sound files for conversion to mp3 or other format using another application (i.e. iTunes). The track length setting in the Playback menu sets the length of recorded tracks.To record the current track in the player window, select "Export current track" from the File menu. If the channels window is open, muting will be applied to the track during conversion.  You can also choose "export stems" directly from the channel window, which will bounce all channels to separate audio files for easy remixing and sampling.Solving ProblemsUpdate File Icon When Played in the preferences window changes the icon of files as they are played (if the icon is not already correct). It is useful when a downloaded music file doesn't have the proper icon. Use the music utility if this isn't sufficient.*If you're having trouble with a game music file or archive, drop it alone on the Game Music Box application icon to perform extra checking and report why it won't play. One limitation is that archives must contain music from only one system (manually expand the archive if it contains music for multiple systems).If tracks seem to be playing in an unexpected order, be sure that Shuffle and Skip Short Tracks in the Playback menu aren't checked.Currently some RAR archives (those with solid compression) require over 30 megabytes of free memory when reading from them. Changing tracks within them might also be slow, especially when going to the previous track or using RAR archives of large GYM files. If this is a problem, expand the RAR archive with a decompression utility first.Some GYM soundtracks use internal compression that Game Music Box doesn't support. Attempt to play these will give an error. It might be possible to find an uncompressed version. Contact me if Further InformationIf you encounter any problems, please report what happened and what music you were playing at the time (and preferably what site you downloaded it from). If running Mac OS X, include a copy of the crash log if possible. See the development section of the web site for a list of known problems.Join the discussion group to post questions, ideas, and bug reports:    https://github.com/dgventura/gambl/issuesVisit the home page for the latest version, development progress, and source code:    https://github.com/dgventura/gambl/wikiChange LogVersion 0.2 (Alpha)- WAV output

Sound Engine DetailsSega Genesis GYM files are played using an enhanced decoder which compensates somewhat for the GYM format's poor representation of samples. Super Nintendo SPC files are emulated at 32kHz as closely as possible to SNES hardware, then resampled to the output rate. The one "enhancement" is removal of the annoying pseudo-surround some games add using inverted left/right phases. The stereo sound slider pans the first two channels from the center to the left and right and adds reverb to them, and adds echo to the other channels. Whenever sound is paused, stopped, resumed, or skipped, a very short fade is used to prevent clicking (channel muting does click).Up to 20 seconds of silence are skipped at the beginning of a track before treating it as a non-playable track (Game Boy, Zelda: Link's Awakening, track 61). Tracks without timing information are automatically ended when six seconds of silence are encountered (Game Boy, Metroid 2, track 6). When the channels window is open, automatic silence skipping is disabled and sound latency is lowered to provide immediate feedback of changes to muting and sound customization.LegalGaMBL is copyright (C) 2013 by David Ventura.
